          Sonam Chandnani is on a mission to raise mental health awareness.
          She's passionate about empowering individuals to work on their mental
          health well being. She is successfully practising Clinical Psychology
          and has rendered helping hands to many individuals. Before she could
          develop taste for MBBS, Psychology found her. Talking about her
          strength, empathy comes from within. She's deemed crazy in friendship
          and a sniffer of problems in her friends' life. And yes, probably has
          the most sensitive taste buds in the world.
